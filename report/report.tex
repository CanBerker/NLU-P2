\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Natural language is
You can keep this short. Ideally you introduce the task already in a way that highlights the difficulties  your method will tackle.

\section{Methodology}
The idea of our approach follows that of successes in previous work such as \cite{UWNLP} and \cite{COGCOMP}. More specifically our approach consists of training a binary logistic regression classifier based on an augmented data set which we create ourselves. This augmentation is based on ideas that have been successfully used in the past (e.g. \cite{LSTMClassifier}). As features for our classifier we consider a collection of feature extractors which produce a vector of features for any 5 sentence story.

\subsection{Data augmentation}
The augmented data set is composed of labeled 5 sentence stories. We create it by combining the original data set and a negative data set. Here the original dataset gets assigned a positive label and the negative set a negative label. We compose the negative dataset by replacing the ending of each 5 sentence story by a randomly selected ending, as done by \cite{LSTMClassifier}. We use a replication factor of 1, i.e. for every sample of the original training set we add a single negative sample.

\subsection{Feature extraction}
In order to fit a logistic regression model as described above we use features obtained from feature extractors. A feature extractor is simply a model which takes in a 5 sentence story and outputs a feature or vector of features. Feature extractors are discussed extensively in section 3. To obtain the final set of features we simply combine features from all extractors for each sample.
%Your idea. You can rename this section if you like. Early on in this section -- but not necessarily first -- make clear what category your method falls into: Is it generative? Discriminative? Is there a particular additional data source you want to use?

\section{Model}

	\end{figure}

The core components of our approach can be seen in figure \ref*{Main}. As described in section 2, the $C_i$ are the feature extractors and indicates a mapping:
\begin{equation}
C: \mathbb{S}^5 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^l
\end{equation}
That is, it's a function of the set of all 5 sentence stories ($\mathbb{S}^5$) to a real vector. 

%The math/architecture of your model. This should formally describe your idea from above. If you really want to, you can merge the two sections.

\section{Training}
\label{sec:training}
%What is your objective? How do you optimize it?

In this section, we describe the results for the different extractors we apply
to the {\it Story Cloze task} as well as for our Ensemble method. For all our
approaches, the training set is first augmented as previously explained and then
used to train each of our extractors.

Table \ref{tab:params} shows the number of trainable parameters of the models we
used for the task and additionally the training duration. Our models were
trained using 15\% of the entire training data as validation data for training.
The accuracy with the actual validation set is evaluated after training is
completed.

    \caption{Training parameters.}

        \begin{tabular}{||c c c||} 
            \hline

            Embedded closeness     & 0                         & $ \approx $ 5 secs.  \\
            \hline
            LSTM classifier        & $ \approx $ 200K          & 20 epochs \\ %$ \approx $ 1.2 hours \\

            Language model         & $ \approx $ 1M            & 20 epochs \\ %$ \approx $ 20 hours \\

            \textbf{Ensemble}      & 80                        & $ \approx $ 45 secs.  \\ [1ex] 
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

The \lstm classifier was trained for 20 epochs using 15\% of the entire training
data as validation data for training. We did not perform more training epochs
due to the fact that we observed a decrease in the validation accuracy and an
increase of the loss function, i.e., the model was overfitting.  The language
model was trained for 20 epochs using a similar configuration as the \lstm
classifier. We observed that the loss function was still improving with the
number of epochs done. The sentiment trajectory method is based on using a
random forest classifier, thus its training phase is similar to other
classification methods and in this case is not time consuming.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

Table \ref{tab:results} shows the accuracy obtained by different methods on the
validation and the provided test set. 

\begin{table}
    \caption{Accuracy on different data sets.}
    \begin{center}
        \label{tab:results}
        \begin{tabular}{||c c c||} 
            \hline
            Method                 & \# Validation set         & Test set \\ [0.5ex] 
            \hline\hline
            Sentiment trajectory   & 61.2\%                    & \textbf{60.4\%} \\ 
            \hline
            Embedded closeness     & 56.5\%                    & 55.4\% \\
            \hline
            LSTM classifier        & 51.4\%                    & 51.3\% \\ 
            \hline
            Language model         & 51.2\%                    & 50.02\% \\ [1ex] 
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

Our approaches based on neural models were not able to perform as expected on
this task. For example, the \lstm classifier scored really high while training
(around 80\% accuracy). However it was not table to perform so well for the
task. This is because the model is able to capture sentences with the same
content, i.e., sentences containing the same subject, similar verbs and so on,
but not all stories contain the same subjects and verbs. Many times the stories
have a twist that our model is not able to capture although it might be obvious
for a human. Moreover, our language model was not able to go beyond a 50\%
accuracy on the test set. 

On the other hand, the sentiment trajectory model is able to capture the how the
story is actually evolving along the sentences. Thus, with this method we were
able to score a high accuracy on both data sets.

%This {\bf must} at least include the accuracy of your method on the validation set.
